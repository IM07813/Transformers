This repository focuses on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and the utilization of transformers, which serve as the foundation for some of the most influential 
natural language models available today. It will include pre-trained models sourced from Hugging Face as well as custom models developed from scratch using PyTorch.

The Hugging Face Transformers library provides state-of-the-art pre-trained models for NLP tasks, such as BERT, GPT, GPT-2, Transformer-XL, XLNet, XLM, 
and RoBERTa. These models can be directly used or fine-tuned for specific tasks, significantly reducing the time and resources required for training 
a model from scratch.

To use a pre-trained model from Hugging Face, the from_pretrained method is utilized. This method supports various options, such as specifying cache directories, 
forcing downloads, using authentication tokens, and selecting specific model versions.

this repository will explore NLP tasks using transformers as the backbone. It will leverage both pre-trained models from the Hugging Face library and custom models built 
with PyTorch, providing a comprehensive and flexible approach to tackling various NLP problems..
