## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to exploring and implementing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques using transformers. Transformers have revolutionized the field of NLP, serving as the foundation for some of the most powerful and influential language models available today.

Our project aims to provide a comprehensive resource for both utilizing pre-trained models and developing custom solutions, catering to a wide range of NLP tasks and applications.

## Features

- Integration with Hugging Face Transformers library
- Implementation of custom transformer models using PyTorch
- Exploration of various NLP tasks and techniques
- Flexible approach to tackle diverse NLP problems
- Comparative analysis between pre-trained and custom models

## Pre-trained Models

We leverage the Hugging Face Transformers library to access state-of-the-art pre-trained models for NLP tasks. Some of the models included are:

- BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
- GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)
- GPT-2
- Transformer-XL
- XLNet
- XLM (Cross-lingual Language Model)
- RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach)

These models can be used directly or fine-tuned for specific tasks, significantly reducing the time and resources required for training a model from scratch.

## Custom Models

In addition to pre-trained models, this repository includes custom transformer models built from the ground up using PyTorch. These models allow for greater flexibility and customization to suit specific NLP tasks or unique data requirements.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nlp-transformers-repo.git
   cd nlp-transformers-repo
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Explore the Jupyter notebooks in the `examples/` directory to see how to use pre-trained models and create custom ones.

## Usage

### Using Pre-trained Models

To use a pre-trained model from Hugging Face, utilize the `from_pretrained` method. This method supports various options for customization:

```python
from transformers import AutoModel, AutoTokenizer

model_name = "bert-base-uncased"
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(model_name)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Use the model and tokenizer for your NLP task
```

### Creating Custom Models

To create a custom transformer model using PyTorch, refer to the examples in the `custom_models/` directory. Here's a basic structure:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class CustomTransformer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, ...):
        super().__init__()
        # Define your model architecture here
    
    def forward(self, ...):
        # Implement the forward pass
```
